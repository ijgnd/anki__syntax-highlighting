<b>This add-on is only a fork (modified version).</b>

My version only has a different user interface which I think is more flexible to use and setup. If you don't need this or run into problems with my version use the original. The original has been downloaded thousands of times and there are no negative reviews over the last months so it really works well. Have a look at the original first. 

Use my version at your own risk! Only use it if you have backups and know how to restore them.

Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="" rel="nofollow">github</a> or via reddit (/u/ijgnord). 

<b># css classes</b>
I use the css option. This allows to change the styling later, e.g. when I'm using night mode. Only the default layout is adjusted to the anki nightmode. I haven't tested other layouts.

This add-on just adds a different GUI. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants (tmbb, glutanimate, renerocksai). Thanks to the original authors of this addon. I didn't make a pull request to the original repo because my version is different and maybe some people prefer the old menu in the buttons bar, because it's less well tested, and because my code doesn't adhere to the<a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/docs/blob/master/anki/add-ons/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-contribute-to-my-anki-add-ons" rel="nofollow">guidelines for contributions the current maintainer glutanimate recently published</a>.
